# Sass for Fun

By this point, you probably realize that Sass is an extremely powerful tool for writing DRY, modular code. I’m not going to be talking about the nuances of Sass optimizations and structure. Instead, I’m going to be talking about what got me into using Sass in the first place — it’s just a lot of fun.

I wrote a lot of Sass that I never put into production, but through the process of play, I learned key programming concepts like traversing through maps and interpolation, and it even led me to playing with javascript. Eventually, I created tools like Sass Director and a node CLI for Sass docs. I’ll walk you through advanced Sass examples like making pixel art with complex functions, and also talk about more basic experiments like playing with color to make dynamic color schemes.
